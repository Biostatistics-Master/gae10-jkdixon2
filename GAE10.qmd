## Scenario 1: Ecology, Behavior, and Coraciiformes Color

Coraciiform species (@fig-Kingfishers) have diverse plumage coloration including pigmentary and structural colors, live in a range of different environments, show variable levels of territoriality, variability in the presence or absence of cooperative breeding (but with near uniform social monogamy), and different types of hunting strategy. @babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023 measured plumage coloration from digital images of museum specimens and quantified several proxies for factors that could play a key role in the evolution of coloration including sex, body size, hunting strategy, habitat light environment, territoriality, and social mating system. They were interested in exploring how different possible biotic and abiotic factors may have affected the evolution of Coraciiform coloration.

### Methods:

The researchers used study skins of 117 species of Coraciiformes (families Meropidae, Brachypteraciidae, Coraciidae, Todidae, Momotidae, Alcedinidae) from the bird collections of the Natural History Museum at Tring, UK. Calibrated digital images of study skins were taken using methods described in @cooneySexualSelectionPredicts2019 and were used to quantify both chromatic (hue and saturation) and achromatic (brightness) components of color for each of several body regions (patches). The selected body regions were: crown, nape, mantle, rump, tail, wing coverts, wing primaries and secondaries, throat, breast, belly, and tail underside. They then used mapping functions to convert red-green-blue values for each patch on each specimen into values appropriate for the visual abilities of this order. Then they calculated average patch values (separately for each sex) as a species-level measure for each body patch. They then used principle components analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the color data across body patches and species and found that the first principle component accounted for \>80% of the variation in color [@babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023]. @babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023 then collated information on: body size; light-level associated habitat preference; hunting strategies; territoriality; and cooperative breeding from available literature.

#### Statistical Methods:

I used principal components analysis to examine the patterns of coloration in data provided by @babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023. All analyses were conducted in R [@base], and I used the PCA function from the FactoMineR package [@FactoMineR] to conduct a principal components analysis both on individuals and on the variables. Using the tidyverse, kableExtra, FactoMineR, and factoextra packages, I visualized the PCA and analyzed the results [@tidyverse; @kableExtra; @FactoMineR; @factoextra]. A PCA was run on the groups of birds based on degree of parental care, hunting strategy, light environment, and territoriality, and the one for hunting strategy was included because it showed the highest separation between individuals.

```{r}
#| label: Scenario1DataImport

# I have provided the PCA1 scores for the patches (columns 2-12) as an index of
# the complex color data for each species (rows) as well as the body size (a
# quantitative supplementary variable, column 13) and ecological behavioral
# classifications (qualitative supplemental variables, columns 14-17) in
# colors.csv. Please explore any grouping and/or patterning among the species
# and their ecological/behavioral traits.


scen1data <- read_csv("colors.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

```

### Results

```{r}
#| label: fig-scen1biplot
#| fig-cap: "PCA for Color of Different Areas of the Body for Kingfishers Based on Hunting Strategy"
#| fig-asp: 0.8

scen1PCA <- PCA(
  scen1data,
  quanti.sup = 13,
  quali.sup = c(1,14:17),
  graph = FALSE
)

Indfig <- fviz_pca_ind(
  scen1PCA,
  repel = TRUE,
  label = "none",
  habillage = 
    "Hunting_strategy"
  )


Varfig <- fviz_pca_var(
  scen1PCA,
  repel = TRUE,
  label = "var"
)

Varfig +
  Indfig +
  plot_layout(ncol =1)

```

```{r}
summary(scen1PCA)

```

The PCA showed that dorsal areas of the bird (tail, rump, nape, and wing) are more closely correlated with principal component 1, and ventral areas of the bird (belly, breast, throat, and tail underside were more closely related with principal component 2 (@fig-scen1biplot). A positive position on PC1 was associated with dorsal areas of the bird appearing more blue, and a positive position on PC2 was associated with the underside of the bird appearing more red/green. The centroids for each of the four groups were in different quadrants for the PCA examining hunting strategy. Aerial catchers clustered to the left side of the graph, with the centroid located in the upper left quadrant. This suggested that aerial catchers were less blue on their dorsal sides and more red/green on their venters. Ground catchers showed slight clustering to the right side of the graph, with their centroid located in the upper left quadrant. This suggested that their dorsal sides were more likely to be blue, and their venters were more likely to be red/green. The centroid for the ground dwellers was in the lower left quadrant, which means that they were less likely to be blue on their dorsal side or red/green on their ventral side. The centroid for the water divers was in the lower right quadrant, which indicated that they were more likely to be blue on their dorsum and less likely to be red/green on their front side (@fig-colorbiplot).

## Scenario 2: Deer and Forest Plant Communities

White-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) are often considered to be keystone species in forest communities. @sabo2017 conducted surveys of the vegetation and environmental conditions of deer exclusion plots and adjacent plots outside the exclusion areas as part of a larger study to examine the indirect effects of their presence on the plant assemblages.

### Methods:

In Summer 2011, the researchers visited 17 deer exclosures in upland forests of northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP) that were constructed for various previous studies between 1991 and 2002. In each stand, they sampled vegetation and measured key environmental variables inside the fences and in paired ‘deer-access’ plots outside the fences. The latter were in close proximity to the exclosures (always within 100 m), and were placed in locations with similar management histories and overstory structure and composition. Within each exclosure and control area, multiple quadrats were sampled and they recorded the incidence of all herbaceous, shrub, and tree seedling species.

#### Statistical Methods:

An NMDs was performed on the data from @sabo2017 using the metaMDS function from the vegan package [@vegan]. Then, a PERMANOVA was run using the adonis2 function from the vegan package and created a table using the kbl function from the kableExtra package [@vegan-3, @kableExtra-2].

```{r}
#| label: Scenario2DataImport

# I have provided data representing the proportion of quadrats each species
# (columns) was found in as a an index of abundance within each deer exclosure
# (rows) in Sabo_etal_data.csv.

# Use NMDS to explore the differences in plant community inside and outside the
# deer exclosures, then test for differences in the plant communities between
# the deer exclosures and the adjacent forests.

deer <- read_csv("Sabo_etal_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

### Results

```{r}
#| label: deernMDS
#| results: "hide"

deermds <- metaMDS(
  deer[,-c(1:2)],
  k = 4
)

deermds$stress

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-deerPERMANOVA
#| tbl-cap: "PERMANOVA to test for a difference in plant assemblages between deer exclusion areas and adjacent areas"

deerPERMANOVA <- adonis2(
  deer[,-c(1,2)] ~ Treatment,
  data = deer,
  by = "margin",
  permutations = 10001
)

kbl(
  deerPERMANOVA,
  format = "markdown",
  degits = c(0,3,3,3,3),
  col.names = c(
    "df",
    "SS",
    "$R^2$",
    "F",
    "P"
    
  )
)

```

The results of the PERMANOVA resulted in a p-value for treatment of p \> 0.05 (@tbl-deerPERMANOVA). Because of this, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the plant communities in deer-exclusion and deer-inclusion zones and believe the plant communities in both habitats to be statistically the same.
